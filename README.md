# Sarcasam_detection

Our study leverages advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques to address the challenge of detecting sarcasm in Tamil text. The process begins with thorough data cleaning and preprocessing to remove undesirable characters and standardize the text for analysis. The preprocessed data is tokenized and prepared for use in machine learning models. Three models are explored: DistilBERT, GRU, and LSTM. DistilBERT, a lightweight yet powerful model, effectively captures subtle contextual nuances in text, making it particularly suitable for sarcasm detection. A GRU-based model, implemented using PyTorch, is designed to handle sequential text data, incorporating techniques like dropout regularization and bidirectional layers to enhance performance. The LSTM model, developed using Keras, is fine-tuned through hyperparameter optimization to improve its ability to identify sarcasm in Tamil text. This study highlights the importance of customized NLP solutions for sarcasm detection in specific languages and provides valuable insights for advancing multilingual sentiment analysis research.
